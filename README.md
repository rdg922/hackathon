# Dino Luzzi Energy Website Redesign

This project is a submission for the Dino Luzzi Energy Challenge as part of the OSCHack's 24-hour hackathon. The challenge was to infuse the [Dino Luzzi Energy](https://dinoluzzi.com/) website with fresh functionality, UI/UX design, and style in just 24 hours. The goal was to improve the company's functionality and make it easier for people to purchase the product.

## Features

- **3D Car Model**: To represent the Dino Luzzi Racing team, we've included a 3D car model in the website. This adds an interactive element to the site and pays homage to the company's racing roots.
- **Improved UI/UX**: We've redesigned the website to improve the user experience and make it easier for customers to navigate and purchase products.
