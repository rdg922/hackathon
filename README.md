# Dino Luzzi Energy Website Redesign

This project is a submission for the Dino Luzzi Energy Challenge as part of the OSCHack's 24-hour hackathon. The challenge was to infuse the [Dino Luzzi Energy](https://dinoluzzi.com/) website with new functionality, UI/UX design, and style to make it more engaging and easier for people to purchase the product.

## Features

- **Overhauled UI/UX**: We've redesigned the website with a flat, modern look to make it easier for customers to understand the main selling points of the product.
- **Interactive 3d Scene**: As a nod to the Dino Luzzi Racing team, we've included the Dino Luzzi racecar in the the website. This adds an interactive element to the site to engage with customers and present information in a novel and interesting way.
